# Overwatch-2-anti-kick-script
This script moves your character forward and backward so you don't get removed for being afk

Run the script you have 3 seconds to swtich back to the game and it will press W for .5 seconds then press A for .5 seconds if you want to stop it alt tab and move the mouse to the top left of the screen to activeate
the pyautogui failsafe.

THIS DOESNT ACTUALLY WORK IN SPAWN YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE SPAWN FOR IT TO WORK BECAUSE THE GAME DETECTS THAT YOU HAVENT LEFT SPAWN AND WILL STILL KICK YOU REGARDLESS IF YOU ARE MOVING OR NOT XDDDDD!!!
